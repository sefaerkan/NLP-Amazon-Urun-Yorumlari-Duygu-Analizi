# Amazon Reviews Dataset

### This dataset contains several million reviews of Amazon products, with the reviews separated into two classes for positive and negative reviews. The two classes are evenly balanced here.
###  I applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on these reviews, which allowed me to classify them based on the expressed sentiment, helping to identify trends in customer feedback and improve product recommendations.
